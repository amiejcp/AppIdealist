This is a practice application created by Amie Parker (amiejcp).

I intend to create this to practice general rails skills (not following a tutorial but using google when I need help) and experiment with different designs.

I probably will then fill it with a list of app ideas to create next.

I am referring to railstutorial.org mostly for help but trying to do some of it without help, too.
